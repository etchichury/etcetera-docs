# Architecture

## Overview

For now, the application's architecture is extremelly simple (and I'll try to
maintain this way). There is a frontend client and a backend service. The
client makes requests to the server using HTTP, and the server responds
with a proper response.

## Tools

### Development environment:

- Code editor: Visual Studio Code
- API client: Postman
- OS/Shell: Pop!\_OS/zsh
- Main browser: Firefox [Latest]
- Machines: ThinkPad T480 & Desktop Ryzen5 3600XT / 16GB RAM / RTX 2060

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: TypeScript/React
- Backend: Python/FastAPI
